  The objective of the task is to navigate a field of obstacles and reach the finish line. When the simulation starts, a countdown timer of 180 seconds would automatically start. It will stop when you reach the finish line, or 0 to zero if you collide with an obstacle.<br>

  The following instructions need to be followed while making a final submission video of Task 2:
  1. Make sure you've followed the instructions on the Task 2 Problem Statement Page and have edited the teaminfo.json file by replacing the placeholder with your team ID.<br>
  2. Go to the metrics tab.<br>
  3. Start the simulation using the Webots interface.<br>
  4. The countdown timer will start counting down from 180 seconds.<br>
  5. As you traverse towards the goal line the completion percentage will increase, it is indicated in the Progress field.<br>
  6. If you collide with an obstacle countdown timer will go to 0.<br>
  7. Login to the eYSRC portal and upload the zip file obtained in the Task 2 folder.<br>

      <h2>How to improve complete the task?</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic controller is an open-loop program that simply sets the velocity and waits for a given time until the robot reaches
      the desired position. The simplest thing to improve the performance is to tune the duration of the steps in order to improve
      the precision of the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more elegant solution would be to use the wheel sensors of the robot. The Pioneer 3-DX has sensors in its wheel that allows the robot to know
      the distance travelled so far. By using this value you can make the robot stop after exactly 2 meters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to use a sensor, you first have to enable it, as they are disabled by default.
    </p>
    <code>rightWheelSensor = robot.getPositionSensor('right wheel sensor')</code><br>
    <code>rightWheelSensor.enable(16) # Refreshes the sensor every 16ms.</code>
    <p>
      You can then access the value of the sensor with its <code>getValue()</code> method.
    </p>
    <code>rightWheelSensor.getValue()</code>
    <p>
      Some information about the robot that can be useful to improve the controller:
      <ul>
        <li>The diameter of the wheels is 195mm.</li>
        <li>The distance between the two wheels is 330mm.</li>
      </ul>
