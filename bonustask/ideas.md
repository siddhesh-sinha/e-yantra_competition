# Ideas for Task
Pitch your ideas below-

1. Moving obstacles

    => As the moving cubes were in task2, we can do something similar

    => Also, as the e-puck already knows how to move through the arena with curves, the boundaries (if posssible) can also be constanltly changing shape

2. Adding new objects

    => We can add new and different objects found in Webots, like a ball etc.

                                                                                 ---X---
